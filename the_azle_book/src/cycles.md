# Cycles

This chapter is a work in progress.

Cycles are essentially units of computational resources such as bandwidth, memory, and CPU instructions. Costs are generally metered on the Internet Computer (IC) by cycles. You can see [a breakdown of all cycle costs here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/production/computation-and-storage-costs).

Currently queries do not have any cycle costs.

Most important to you will probably be update costs.

TODO break down some cycle scenarios maybe? Perhaps we should show some of our analyses for different types of applications. Maybe show how to send and receive cycles, exactly how to do it.

Show all of the APIs for sending or receiving cycles?

Perhaps we don't need to do that here, since each API will show this information.

Maybe here we just show the basic concept of cycles, link to the main cycles cost page, and show a few examples of how to break down these costs or estimate these costs.
