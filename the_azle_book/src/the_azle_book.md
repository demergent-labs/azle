Welcome to The Azle Book! This is a guide for building secure decentralized/replicated servers in TypeScript or JavaScript on <a href="https://internetcomputer.org" target="_blank">ICP</a>. The current replication factor is [13-40 times](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnets).

Please remember that Azle stable mode is continuously subjected to [intense scrutiny and testing](https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/actions), however it does not yet have multiple independent security reviews/audits.
