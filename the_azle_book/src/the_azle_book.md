Welcome to The Azle Book! This is a guide for building secure decentralized/replicated servers in TypeScript or JavaScript on [ICP](https://internetcomputer.org/). The current replication factor is [13-40 times](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/subnets).

Please remember that Azle is in beta and thus it may have unknown security vulnerabilities due to the following:

-   Azle is built with various software packages that have not yet reached maturity
-   Azle does not yet have multiple independent security reviews/audits
-   Azle does not yet have many live, successful, continuously operating applications deployed to ICP
