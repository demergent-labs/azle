This book is intended to be an in-depth guide to [canister](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/concepts/canisters-code) development in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) (IC).

The first 19 chapters are an introductory guide into canister development with [Azle](./azle.md). These chapters build on each other concept by concept, introducing the fundamentals required to create and deploy canisters to the IC.

Chapter 20 is an in-depth reference of the APIs available to Azle canisters.

Our intention is for new developers to use this book as a tutorial or course, starting at chapter 1 and working through chapter 19, using chapter 20 as a reference.

There will also be a companion video series on YouTube. Each chapter here will begin with the video companion as soon as it is available.

You should expect this book and its companion video series to continue to grow and change over time, as its authors and the IC grow and change.
