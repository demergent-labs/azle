# Candid RPC

> Chapter 3 has been generated by AI based on our repository. The generated documentation is valuable, though it has not yet been meticulously reviewed by human beings. Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/tree/main/examples/stable/test/end_to_end/candid_rpc" target="_blank">examples</a> and the `JSDocs` of the imports from `azle` for the most up-to-date and accurate documentation.

This section documents the Candid RPC methodology for developing Azle applications. This methodology embraces ICP's <a href="https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/interact-with-canisters/candid/candid-concepts" target="_blank">Candid language</a>, exposing canister methods directly to Candid-speaking clients, and using Candid for serialization and deserialization purposes.

Candid RPC is now in the release candidate phase, and is heading towards 1.0 imminently.
