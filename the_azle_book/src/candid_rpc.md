# Candid RPC

This section documents the Candid RPC methodology for developing Azle applications. This methodology embraces ICP's Candid language, exposing canister methods directly to Candid-speaking clients, and using Candid for serialization and deserialization purposes.

Candid RPC is heading towards 1.0 and production-readiness in 2025.
