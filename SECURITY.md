# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in helping to keep Azle secure.

If you have found a security vulnerability, we ask you to reach out to us privately according to the guidelines found in this security policy. We also ask that you refrain from opening any GitHub issues related to or publicly discussing any specific security vulnerability found in Azle until it has been resolved and publicly acknowledged by Demergent Labs.

## Supported Versions

We will only update Azle in response to security vulnerabilities found in its latest published `npm` version:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| >= 0.32.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.32.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in Azle, please open a draft security advisory using GitHub's [vulnerability reporting tool](https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/security/advisories/new).

Once you have opened a draft security advisory, Demergent Labs will do the following:

1. Respond privately to your report within 24 hours.
2. Perform its own assessment of the vulnerability according to [CVSS v4](https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0/specification-document).
3. Address vulnerabilities assessed as `Critical` or `High` as soon as possible, culminating in a published security advisory and a new release of Azle.
4. Address vulnerabilities assessed as `Medium` or lower according to the discretion of Demergent Labs.

We are very grateful to all who work to make Azle more secure. That being said, there are currently no bounties or rewards available for reporting vulnerabilites in Azle. We will credit you in the published security advisory at your discretion.
