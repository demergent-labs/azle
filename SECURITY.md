# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in helping to keep Azle secure.

If you think that you have found a security vulnerability, we ask you to reach out to us privately according to the guidelines found in this security policy. We also ask that you refrain from opening any GitHub issues related to or publicly discussing any specific security vulnerability found in Azle until it has been resolved and publicly acknowledged by Demergent Labs.

## Supported Versions

We will only update Azle in response to security vulnerabilities found in its latest stable [GitHub release](https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/releases) and corresponding published [npm version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azle?activeTab=versions).

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability in Azle, please open a draft security advisory using GitHub's [vulnerability reporting tool](https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/security/advisories/new). If for some reason you cannot open a draft security advisory, please send an email to security@demergentlabs.org without disclosing any details about the security vulnerability. You will be sent information to set up a secure channel for further communication.

Once Demergent Labs has received the initial necessary information from you, we will do the following:

1. Respond privately to you within 3 business days.
2. Remain in regular private contact with you to share our progress and ask for appropriate information and guidance.
3. Perform our own assessment of the vulnerability according to [CVSS v4](https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0/specification-document).
4. Address vulnerabilities assessed as `Critical` or `High` as soon as possible, culminating in a published security advisory and [CVE ID](https://www.cve.org/) and a new release of Azle.
5. Address vulnerabilities assessed as `Medium` or lower according to our own discretion.

We are very grateful to all who work to make Azle more secure. That being said, there are currently no bounties or rewards available for reporting vulnerabilities in Azle. We will credit you by mentioning your name/username of choice in the published security advisory unless you choose to opt out.
