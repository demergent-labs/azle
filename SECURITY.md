# Security Policy

Thank you for helping to keep Azle secure. If you have found a security vulnerability, we ask you to please reach out to us privately according to the guidelines found in this security policy.

Until a specific security vulnerability has been fixed and publicly acknowledged by Demergent Labs, we ask you to please refrain from opening any GitHub issues related to or publicly discussing any specific security vulnerability found in Azle.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in Azle, please open a draft security advisory using GitHub's [vulnerability reporting tool](https://github.com/demergent-labs/azle/security/advisories/new).

Once you have submitted a vulnerability, the following process will occur:

1. Demergent Labs will respond privately to your report within 24 hours.
2. Demergent Labs will perform its own assessment of the vulnerability according to [CVSS v4](https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0/specification-document).
3. Vulnerabilities assessed as `Critical` or `High` will be addressed as soon as possible, culminating in a published security advisory and a new release of Azle.
4. Vulnerabilities assessed as `Medium` or lower will be addressed according to the discretion of Demergent Labs.

We are very grateful to all who work to make Azle more secure. That being said, there are currently no bounties or rewards available for reporting vulnerabilites in Azle.

We will credit you in the published security advisory at your discretion.
