From https://262.ecma-international.org/13.0/#sec-imports 16.2.2
Import Declarations come in two flavors
    1) import ImportClause FromClause;
    2) import ModuleSpecifier;

Option 2 does side effects only
Import Clause breakdown
    1) ImportedDefaultBinding (thing) (import thing from 'thing')
    2) NameSpaceImport (* as thing) (import * as thing from 'thing')
    3) NamedImports
        a) ({}) (import {} from 'thing')
        b) {ImportsList}
            i) ({thing}) (import {thing} from 'thing')
            ii) ({thing as other}) (import {thing as other} from 'thing')
        c) {ImportsList,}
            i) ({thing, }) (import {thing, } from 'thing')
            ii) ({thing1 as other1, }) (import {thing1 as other1, thing2 as other2} from 'thing')
        d) Combos
            i) ({thing1, thing2 as other2}) ({thing1, thing2 as other2})
            ii) ({thing1 as other1, thing2}) ({thing1, thing2 as other2})
    4) ImportedDefaultBinding, NameSpaceImport (thing, * as other from 'thing')
    5) ImportedDefaultBinding, NamedImports (thing, {thing as other} from 'thing')
        a) there could be all sorts of combos in here
