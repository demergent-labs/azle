**Note on calculations:**
- All calculations assume a 13-node subnet
- Cycles are calculated using the formula: base_fee + per_instruction_fee \* number_of_instructions
- base_fee: 5_000_000 cycles
- per_instruction_fee: 1 cycle
- USD value is derived from the total cycles, where 1 trillion cycles = 1 XDR, and 1 XDR = $1.37 (as of June 27, 2025)

For the most up-to-date XDR to USD conversion rate, please refer to the [IMF website](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx).
For the most current fee information, please check the [official documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/references/cycles-cost-formulas).
