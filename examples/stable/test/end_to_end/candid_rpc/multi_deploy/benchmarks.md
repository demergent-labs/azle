**Note on calculations:**

- Cycles are calculated using the formula: base_fee + (per_instruction_fee \* number_of_instructions) + (additional_fee_per_billion \* floor(number_of_instructions / 1_000_000_000))
- base_fee: 590_000 cycles
- per_instruction_fee: 0.4 cycles
- additional_fee_per_billion: 400_000_000 cycles per billion instructions
- USD value is derived from the total cycles, where 1 trillion cycles = 1 XDR, and 1 XDR = $1.329670 (as of October 24, 2024)

For the most up-to-date XDR to USD conversion rate, please refer to the [IMF website](https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx).
