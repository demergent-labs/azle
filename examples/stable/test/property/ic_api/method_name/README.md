# method_name Tests

## Current Status

We have decided that the `method_name` function is sufficiently tested for release candidate in the following locations:

-   tests/end_to_end/candid_rpc/class_syntax/inspect_message/
-   tests/property/candid_rpc/class_api/canister_methods/inspect_message/

These existing tests provide adequate coverage for the current release candidate. They ensure that all the APIs are called correctly and function as expected.

## Future Work

While the current tests are sufficient for the release candidate, there is potential for future improvements:

1. Add more property-based tests to increase coverage and robustness.
2. Expand test scenarios to cover different ways and places to call these functions.
3. Implement additional edge cases and error handling tests.

## Current Approach

For the time being, we are confident that the existing tests in the end-to-end directory provide enough coverage to proceed with the release candidate. This approach allows us to:

1. Ensure core functionality is working correctly.
2. Meet current release deadlines.
3. Plan for future enhancements in subsequent releases.

As development progresses and more complex use cases arise, we may revisit this decision and expand the test suite accordingly.
