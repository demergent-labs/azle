# This GitHub Action flow works as follows:
# Each directory in the examples and tests directory represents an example project and is intended to have tests that ensure the canisters contained in that example function properly.
# These tests are currently written in TypeScript and are intended to be run in a Node.js environment.
# This GitHub Action takes care of deploying to npm and GitHub.
