# TODO the next great simplification might be deploying multiple examples to one dfx replica instance: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/use-the-same-local-replica-for-multiple-projects/11900
# TODO this might allow us to avoid spinning up so many jobs in the matrix

# This GitHub Action flow works as follows:
# The tests are currently simple example-based integration tests.
# Each directory in the examples directory represents an example project and is intended to have tests that ensure the canisters contained in that example function properly.
# These tests are currently written in TypeScript and are intended to be run in a Node.js environment.
# This GitHub Action takes care of deploying to npm and GitHub.
# Tests can either run against the current code of Azle found in the repository, or the code deployed by the GitHub Action to npm.
# Feature branch pull requests (pull requests without release-- in the base branch name) will run all tests against the code found in the repository.
# Release branch pull requests (pull requests with release-- in the base branch name) will run all tests against the code found in the repository and the code deployed by the GitHub Action to npm.
# Pushes to main will run all tests against the code in the repository if the latest commit was not a merge of a release branch, and will run tests against the code in the repository and the code deployed by the GitHub Action to npm otherwise.
# The basic-integration-tests matrix spins up one job per combination of example directory and code source (repo or npm).
# The check-basic-integration-tests-success job is designed to ensure that all jobs spun up from the matrix in the basic-integration-tests have succeeded
