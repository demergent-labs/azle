-   Azle does not yet have multiple independent security reviews/audits
-   Azle does not yet have many live, successful, continuously operating applications deployed to the IC

## Documentation

## Roadmap

We hope to move Azle from beta to release candidates by the end of 2023, and to move from release candidates to 1.0 in early 2024.

### Blockers for release candidates

-   Good automated property test coverage
-   Settling of API/syntax
-   Good npm package support

### Blockers for 1.0

-   Extensive automated property test coverage
-   Multiple independent security reviews/audits
-   Broad npm package support
