                                Azle's 1.0 release. Its focus is on API and
                                runtime stability, security, performance,
                                TypeScript and JavaScript language support, the

                                (RPC). There is minimal support for the Node.js
                                standard library, npm ecosystem, and HTTP server
                                functionality.

                                willing to accept the risk of using an alpha or
                                beta project. Its focus is on quickly enabling
                                new features and functionality without requiring
                                the time and other resources necessary to
                                advance them to the stable mode. The Node.js
                                standard libary, npm ecosystem, and HTTP server
                                functionality are also major areas of focus.

                                    NOTE: Keep clearly in mind that the
                                    experimental mode fundamentally changes the
                                    Azle Wasm binary. It is not guaranteed to be
                                    secure or stable in API changes or runtime
                                    behavior. If you enable the experimental
                                    mode, even if you only use APIs from the
                                    stable mode, you are accepting a higher risk

                                Azle intends to be a full TypeScript and
                                JavaScript environment for the IC (a
                                decentralized cloud platform), with support for
                                all of the TypeScript and JavaScript language
                                and as many relevant environment APIs as
                                possible. These environment APIs will be similar
                                to those available in the Node.js and web
                                browser environments.

                                One of the core benefits of Azle is that it
                                allows web developers to bring their TypeScript
                                or JavaScript skills to the IC. For example,
                                Azle allows the use of various npm packages and

                                As for the IC, we believe its main benefits can
                                be broken down into the following categories:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="#ownership">Ownership</a></li>
                                <li><a href="#security">Security</a></li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="#developer-experience"
                                        >Developer Experience</a

                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Most of these benefits stem from the
                                decentralized nature of the IC, though the IC is
                                best thought of as a progressively
                                decentralizing cloud platform. As opposed to
                                traditional cloud platforms, its goal is to be
                                owned and controlled by many independent
                                entities.

                                The IC allows you to build applications that are
                                controlled directly and only (with some caveats)
                                by a group of people. This is in opposition to
                                most cloud applications written today, which
                                must be under the control of a very limited
                                number of people and often a single legal entity
                                that answers directly to a cloud provider, which
                                itself is a single legal entity.

                                In the blockchain world, group-owned
                                applications are known as
                                <a

                                the IC allows full-stack applications to be
                                controlled by groups. This means that the group
                                fully controls the running instances of the
                                frontend and the backend code.

                                In addition to allowing applications to be owned
                                by groups of people, the IC also allows
                                applications to be owned by no one. This
                                essentially creates autonomous applications or
                                everlasting processes that execute indefinitely.
                                The IC will essentially allow such an
                                application to run indefinitely, unless it
                                depletes its balance of cycles, or the

                                Because most web APIs are owned and operated by
                                individual entities, their fate is tied to that
                                of their owners. If their owners go out of
                                business, then those APIs may cease to exist. If
                                their owners decide that they do not like or
                                agree with certain users, they may restrict
                                their access. In the end, they may decide to
                                shut down or restrict access for arbitrary
                                reasons.

                            <p>
                                Because the IC allows for group and autonomous
                                ownership of cloud software, the IC is able to
                                produce potentially permanent web APIs. A
                                decentralized group of independent entities will
                                find it difficult to censor API consumers or
                                shut down an API. An autonomous API would take
                                those difficulties to the extreme, as it would
                                continue operating as long as consumers were
                                willing to pay for it.

                                Group and autonomous ownership makes it possible
                                to build neutral cloud software on the IC. This
                                type of software would allow independent parties
                                to coordinate with reduced trust in each other
                                or a single third-party coordinator.

                            <p>
                                This removes the risk of the third-party
                                coordinator acting in its own self-interest
                                against the interests of the coordinating
                                participants. The coordinating participants
                                would also find it difficult to implement
                                changes that would benefit themselves to the
                                detriment of other participants.

                                Because the IC is not owned or controlled by any
                                one entity or individual, the risk of being
                                deplatformed is reduced. This is in opposition
                                to most cloud platforms, where the cloud
                                provider itself generally has the power to
                                arbitrarily remove users from its platform.
                                While deplatforming can still occur on the IC,
                                the only endogenous means of forcefully taking
                                down an application is through an NNS vote.

                                provides a novel approach to self-custody of
                                private keys. The IC automatically authenticates
                                messages with the public key of the signer, and
                                provides a compact representation of that public
                                key, called a principal, to the application. The
                                principal can be used for authorization
                                purposes. This removes many authentication
                                concerns from the developer.

                                The concept of ports and various other low-level
                                network infrastructure on the IC is abstracted
                                away from the developer. This can greatly reduce
                                application complexity thus minimizing the
                                chance of introducing vulnerabilities through
                                incorrect configurations. Canisters expose
                                endpoints through various methods, usually query
                                or update methods. Because authentication is
                                also built-in, much of the remaining
                                vulnerability surface area is minimized to
                                implementing correct authorization rules in the

                                Canisters have at least two layers of sandboxing
                                to protect colocated canisters from each other.
                                All canisters are at their core Wasm modules and
                                thus inherit the built-in Wasm sandbox. In case
                                there is any bug in the underlying
                                implementation of the Wasm execution environment
                                (or a vulnerability in the imported host
                                functionality), there is also an OS-level
                                sandbox. Developers need not do anything to take
                                advantage of these sandboxes.

                                The IC provides many devops benefits
                                automatically. Though currently limited in its
                                scalability, the protocol attempts to remove the
                                need for developers to concern themselves with
                                concepts such as autoscaling, load balancing,
                                uptime, sandboxing, and firewalls/port
                                management.

                                Correctly constructed canisters have a simple

                                The IC automatically persists its heap. This
                                creates an extremely convenient way for
                                developers to store application state, by simply
                                writing into global variables in their
                                programming language of choice. This is a great
                                way to get started.

                                If a canister upgrades its code, swapping out
                                its Wasm binary, then the heap must be cleared.
                                To overcome this limitation, there is a special
                                area of memory called stable memory that
                                persists across these canister upgrades. Special
                                stable data structures provide a familiar API
                                that allows writing into stable memory directly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All of this together provides the foundation for
                                a very simple persistence experience for the
                                developer. The persistence tools now available
                                and coming to the IC may be simpler than their
                                equivalents on traditional cloud infrastructure.

                                It's important to note that both Azle and the IC
                                are early-stage projects. The IC officially
                                launched in May of 2021, and Azle reached beta
                                in April of 2022.

                                Azle reached beta in April of 2022. It's an
                                immature project that may have unforeseen bugs
                                and other issues. We're working constantly to
                                improve it. We hope to get to a production-ready
                                1.0 in 2024. The following are the major
                                blockers to 1.0:

                                The IC launched officially in May of 2021. As a
                                relatively new project with an extremely
                                ambitious vision, you can expect a small
                                community, immature tooling, and an unproven
                                track record. Much has been delivered, but many
                                promises are yet to be fulfilled.

                            <p>
                                Any requests that change state on the IC must go
                                through consensus, thus you can expect latencies
                                of a few seconds for these types of requests.
                                When canisters need to communicate with each
                                other across subnets or under heavy load, these
                                latencies can be even longer. Under these
                                circumstances, in the worst case latencies will
                                build up linearly. For example, if canister A
                                calls canister B calls canister C, and these
                                canisters are all on different subnets or under
                                heavy load, then you might need to multiply the
                                latency by the total number of calls.
                            </p>

                                CPU usage, data storage, and network usage may
                                be more expensive than the equivalent usage on
                                traditional cloud platforms. Combining these
                                costs with the high latencies explained above,
                                it becomes readily apparent that the IC is
                                currently not built for high-performance
                                computing.

                                The IC might not be able to scale to the needs
                                of your application. It is constantly seeking to
                                improve scalability bottlenecks, but it will
                                probably not be able to onboard millions of
                                users to your traditional web application.

                                You should assume that all of your application
                                data (unless it is end-to-end encrypted) is
                                accessible to multiple third-parties with no
                                direct relationship and limited commitment to
                                you. Currently all canister state sits
                                unencrypted on node operator's machines.
                                Application-layer access controls for data are
                                possible, but motivated node operators will have
                                an easy time getting access to your data.

                                The NNS has the ability to uninstall any
                                canister and can generally change anything about
                                the IC protocol. The NNS uses a simple liquid
                                democracy based on coin/token voting and
                                follower relationships. At the time of this
                                writing most of the voting power on the NNS
                                follows DFINITY for protocol changes,
                                effectively giving DFINITY write control to the
                                protocol while those follower relationships
                                remain in place. The NNS must mature and
                                decentralize to provide practical and realistic
                                protections to canisters and their users.
